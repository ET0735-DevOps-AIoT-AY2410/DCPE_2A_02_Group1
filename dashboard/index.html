            <p>
                We are Group 1 of DCPE/FT/2A/02. In line with the Singapore government’s “30 by 30” goal to produce 30% of food locally in
                Singapore by 2030, a tender has been issued to develop an “Automated Gardening System". Due to the limited land area allocated 
                for agriculture, the automated system shall support the monitoring and control of a hydroponics system. 
                To simulate this, we are using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller.

                This webpage presents a Dashboard which visualizes the exciting data from the different hydroponics system sensors and our Raspberry Pi!
